# Typo

![](https://github.com/DeveloperWOW64/Typo/blob/main/Pictures/Typo.png)

# Description:

Typo is a smart little assistant. (at least I hope he will be when I finish him.)
I am coding him in VS Code.
He is not really visual, rather, he is command line based (looks like a command terminal.)

# Important:

I am considering making him in Swift, rather than Python.

# Notes:

src: Source code

exe: Executable code
