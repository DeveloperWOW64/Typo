# Typo

# Description

Typo is a smart little assistant. (at least I hope he will be when I finish him.
I am coding him in VS Code.
He is not really visual, rather, he is command line based (looks like a command terminal.

# Notes:

He is stored in *.py files rather than *.exe or *.app or *.cmd or etc
